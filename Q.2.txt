Q2.
Ans.
1)Justify content---The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

2)Align items---The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. In Grid Layout, it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within their grid area.

3)Gap---The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns.

Early versions of the specification called this property grid-gap, and to maintain compatibility with legacy websites, browsers will still accept grid-gap as an alias for gap.

4)Flex-direction---The flex-direction property is sub-property of flexible box layout module. It established the main axis of the flexible item. the main axis of the flex item is the primary axis. Itâ€™s not necessarily horizontal all the time it basically depends on the flex-direction property. 

Note:The flex property is useless when the element is not flexible item.

5)Flex-wrap---The CSS flex-wrap property is used to specify whether flex items are forced into a single line or wrapped onto multiple lines. The flex-wrap property allows enabling the control direction in which lines are stacked. It is used to designate a single line or multi-line format to flex items inside the flex container.
